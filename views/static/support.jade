    Brasilia USA currently maintains the largest inventory of spare parts 
    for all makes and models of espresso machines. The large inventory allows 
    Brasilia to fill orders in an efficient and timely manner. Parts can be shipped 
    throughout North America from economical ground methods to express overnight 
    delivery. Since inventory arrives by both ocean and air freight from Europe, 
    out of stock parts will be available with short back order time. Brasilia USA 
    also has the largest stock of Brasilia espresso machines, and Rossi grinders 
    in North America. In addition, we are constantly expanding and upgrading our inventory 
    with new options and technology developed by all companies within Gruppo Rossi.

    Brasilia USA also offers a list of lucrative service programs to prevent costly repairs, 
    and ensure optimal equipment performance. They are as follows: 
  h2 Preventative Maintenance Service (PM)
  p.
    <img alt="jeff van" src="/static/img/jeff-van.jpg" />
    Will significantly increase the life of the machine, help avert expensive repairs down 
    the line, as well as improve the quality and taste of the coffee. A technician will come 
    to the customer location and replace the group head showers, gaskets, and anti suction valve, 
    as well as recalibrate pump and static pressures, and “tune up” the rest of the machine. 
    Replacing the group head showers radically enhances the taste of the coffee, as residue 
    from the oils and caramels of coffee builds up on the screen. Replacing the gaskets makes 
    certain that the portafilter and group head form the correct seal to enable the proper 9+ bars of 
    pressure to build up for a perfect espresso extraction. Changing the anti-siphon valve is very 
    important as its responsibility is preventing milk from being sucked back into the boiler. In 
    addition to the services listed, the technician will leave the customer with a report on the 
    machines’ performance, as well as make recommendations and suggestions to ensure the unit 
    continues to operate without flaw. 
  h2 Pro-Active Maintenance Contracts
  p.
    <img alt="servicing" src="/static/img/servicing.jpg" />
    We offer maintenance contracts for all machines to allow our customers to budget for 
    service expenses on an annual basis, as well as provide peace of mind that the machine will 
    be properly cared for. The standard maintenance contract includes PM services to be conducted 
    at 6 month intervals, and covers all repairs to include both parts and labor for the period of 
    one year. In addition, we will customize maintenance agreements for customers in search of a 
    more aggressive approach to both performance, and regularly scheduled service. 
  h2 Asset Management Services
  p.
    Water treatment is vital to the performance of any piece of equipment that utilizes a boiler 
    to heat water. Some say that a water softener is the “lifeline” of an espresso machine as its 
    function is to prevent scale and lime from building up inside the unit. Hard water can destroy 
    a brand new espresso machine in just a few months if measures are not taken to prevent this 
    chemical reaction from occurring. In addition to equipment protection, proper water filtration 
    ensures quality in the taste of the coffee.
  p.
    Brasilia USA keeps a water softener database to track the life and performance of the water 
    systems for its customers at no charge! Once your unit is installed, we test the water quality 
    on location and utilize a detailed formula (provided by our water treatment specialists) to 
    calculate the life of the softener cartridges. When the time comes, a Brasilia technician will 
    call or send an email (depending on customer preference) to let the customer know that it is 
    time to change the softener cartridges. Once we get customer authorization, we will ship the 
    cartridges with instructions, or offer them at a discounted price with the purchase of a PM Service. 
    This is just another value added service that Brasilia USA is happy to offer its customers.

    On behalf of the Brasilia USA service department, we look forward to serving you!
